HTML5SpaceInvaders 
========

Currently setting up a Demo server for this game

### Gameplay
This game is a multi-player js game based on space invaders. There are 2 screens where players compete.

###Rendering
Presently the Canvas is using block graphics to help people (and myself) just see clearly the bounds of objects and stuff. Feel free to Fork the project on my githup account.

###Client-side
There is a ts folder for typescript source and output and a js folder for javascript only stuff. Possibly could mode the angular code over to ts in future.

###peer-to-peer
uses Peer.js

###TODO
* Decide if I need an authoritive server to stop client side cheating.
